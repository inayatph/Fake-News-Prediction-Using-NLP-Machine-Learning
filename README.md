# Fake News Classification Using NLP and Machine Learning


## Overview
- This project involves building a machine learning model to classify news articles as either fake or genuine using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model utilizes a dataset containing labeled news articles and employs various NLP algorithms for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification.

## Dataset
- Text Content: Full text of news articles.
- Label: Binary classification indicating whether the news article is fake (1) or genuine (0).

## Project Structure
- Data Preprocessing: Text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
- Feature Extraction: Utilization of NLP methods such as Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
- Model Training: Construction and training of machine learning models (e.g., Random forest classifier) 
- Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using metrics such as Classification report.
- Inference: Application of the trained model for predicting the authenticity of new news articles.


## Files Included
- fake_news_classification.ipynb: Colab Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.
- README.md: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
- requirements.txt: List of required Python packages and their versions for reproducing the environment.
